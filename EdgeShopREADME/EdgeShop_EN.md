# AdvancedFind - Advanced Search for Edge

An advanced search tool that extends the built-in search functionality of the Edge browser, providing a search experience similar to that of VSCode.

## Features
- Click the extension icon to pop up a small search interface
- Real-time search of text content on web pages
- Supports case-sensitive matching, whole word matching, and regular expression matching
- Highlights all matches
- Provides navigation for previous/next matches
- Displays the current match index and total number of matches
- Use arrow keys to navigate between search results

## Instructions
1. Click the AdvancedFind extension icon in the upper right corner of the browser
2. Enter the text to search in the pop-up search box
3. Click the case-sensitive match (Aa), whole word match (W), or regular expression (.*) button as needed
4. Use the up and down arrow buttons or arrow keys to navigate to the previous or next match
5. The current match will be specially highlighted and automatically scroll to the center of the view
6. Click the close button or press the ESC key to close the search interface

## Notes
- The regular expression pattern must comply with JavaScript regex syntax
